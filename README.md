# aengine
A game and its engine written in assembly using gfx library

# Why I write this in assembly?
Because it's a project at my University.

# Why github?
Because github is a perfect place to track the modifications in the codebase.

# Why not multiplatform?
Because we have to use Windows-specific libraries, but I'd like to make it
multiplatform in the future.
